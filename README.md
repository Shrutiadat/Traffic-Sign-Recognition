# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This Python script demonstrates the implementation of a Traffic Sign Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
The script utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build and train a CNN model for classifying traffic signs into 43 different categories. 
The dataset used is organized into folders, each representing a specific class of traffic sign. The script preprocesses the images, splits the dataset into training and testing sets,
and constructs a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers. The model is trained using the training set and evaluated on the testing set. Additionally, the script visualizes the training 
history by plotting accuracy and loss graphs over epochs. Finally, it tests the trained model on a separate test dataset, calculating and printing the accuracy of the model's predictions.
